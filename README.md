WizeWallet solves the problem of proper financial management for children without credit cards or bank accounts.

The application helps children and teenagers to be more aware and responsible about their savings.

Parents can supervise and review their children's habits of spending money and help them be more calculated about their spending.
First, the parents register their own accounts,

then they can link their children for parental supervision. The child can ask for money from his parents by sending a money request.

Goal completion rewards children for finishing tasks. Parents can review what goals are completed from his user interface and reward their children accordingly.
